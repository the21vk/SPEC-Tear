## Overview

The code calculates growth rates for MHD instabilities by solving the linearized MHD equations in a periodic domain. It uses spectral methods with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) for accurate computation of spatial derivatives and constructs the system matrices efficiently.

Key features:
- Spectral analysis of MHD instabilities
- Computation of growth rates across parameter space
- Visualization of dispersion relations
- Analysis of stability boundaries

## Usage

### Using the Python Module

```python
from mhd_stability import compute_max_real_eigenvalue

# Calculate growth rate for specific parameters
growth_rate = compute_max_real_eigenvalue(
    k_star=0.7,  # Wavenumber
    lam=2.8,     # Width parameter
    N=42,        # Grid resolution
    S=100        # Lundquist number
)

print(f"Growth rate: {growth_rate}")
```


## Theory Background

The code calculates the growth rate for the tearing instability in 3D by examining the eigenvalues of the linearized MHD equations as presented in [our work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10065v1). A positive real part in any eigenvalue indicates instability.

Key parameters:
- `k_star`: Wavenumber
- `lam`: Width parameter controlling the profile function shape
- `S`: Lundquist number (ratio of resistive to Alfv√©n time scales)
- `N`: Grid resolution for the spectral method

Example usage is presented in the notebook [here](exampleUsage.ipynb).
